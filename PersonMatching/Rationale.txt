Rationale behind similarity system.

Weighting:


Phone number
weight 1
Reasoning: Unique value. A match means that the record has to be a correct match
Overrides algorithm. if 1to1 match, return obj {person, 100%, 100%} then continue onto next person in DB until end of DB

Email match
Weight - 1
Reasoning: Again, unique field.
Overrides algorithm. Same as above

Email Prefix
Weight - 0.85
Reasoning: Extremely low probability. can be made up of nums&chars so many more possibilities.

Name
Weight - 0.7
Reasoning: Very low probability but not impossible. Also common names increase chances e.g John, Olivia & common surenames like Smith

Address:
Weight - 0.6
Reasoning: Likelihood is very low however, there are instances in America (upon research) where house numbers and street names are not unique within the same city

DOB
Weight - 0.45
Reasoning: Chance of 2 individuals having same Birthday is 1/365. This is low but much higher in comparison to probability of fields above

Age
Weight - 0.2
Reasoning: Assuming app is for individuals age 18+ and avg life expectancy in America is 78, The chance of 2 people having the same birthday is 1/60 (78-18). quite high.

Favourite Colour
Weight - 0.1
Reasoning: 7 main colours to choose from (ROYGBIV). 1/7 is very high



How I will work out similarity score & confidence score:
WS = weighted score

fuzzy score gets multiplied by weight.
fuzzy score = x
weighted score = x * weight for corresponding property (excluding overrides)

confidence score = sum of weighted scores / sum of weights assigned to each property

if confidence score above certain threshold, add to result else, next record 
similarity score = Sum of fuzzy scores / sum of max score possible (excluding overrides)
